                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p><strong>Spam musubi</strong> is a popular snack in Hawaii.
                    It is a type of sushi that features marinated cooked
                    Spam and rice wrapped with nori. I got this recipe from
                    a local Hawaiian friend when I was living there.</p>
